**Status:** Strategic Planning Phase  

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a comprehensive 12-month implementation strategy to achieve complete OCEAN personality facet coverage across the IOC framework. The plan addresses critical gaps identified in the facet-to-node mapping analysis and builds upon the existing Executive/Organizational tier implementations.

### Current State Assessment

- **Implementation Status**: Executive and Organizational tiers largely complete
- **Critical Gaps**: 13 facets require new nodes or enhanced mappings
- **Priority Areas**: Emotional regulation, social dynamics, aesthetic sensitivity

### Strategic Objectives
1. Achieve 90%+ direct facet coverage by Q4 2025
2. Enhance assessment accuracy by 35% through facet-level precision
3. Enable tier-specific personality expressions (Individual → Executive → Organizational)
4. Establish scientific validation framework for personality-performance correlations

interface APIVersioning {
  v1: LegacyOceanEndpoints; // Maintain backward compatibility
  v2: FacetEnhancedEndpoints; // New facet-level endpoints
  v3: RealTimeEndpoints; // Future real-time capabilities
}

// Enhanced response structures
interface EnhancedAPIResponse {
  version: string;
  data: FacetProfile | OceanProfile; // Support both formats
  metadata: {
    facetCoverage: number;
    confidenceScore: number;
    lastUpdated: Date;
  };

    });
    
    it('should maintain correlation with Big 5 scores', () => {
      // Verify facet aggregation matches trait scores
    });
    
    it('should handle missing data gracefully', () => {
      // Test partial response handling
    });
  });
  
  describe('Tier Expression', () => {
    it('should generate tier-specific expressions', () => {
      // Test individual → executive → organizational progression
    });
    
    it('should maintain consistency across tiers', () => {
      // Verify logical progression of expressions
    });
  });
});
```

#### Integration Testing Framework
