## Integrated Assessment Approach

### Stress Amplification Assessment
"Think about a recent high-pressure situation at work. Which of these best describes your response?"

For each trait extreme, provide scenario-based options that reveal how stress amplifies dark side tendencies.

### Team Impact Assessment
"Consider feedback you've received about your impact on team dynamics. Which themes appear most frequently?"

Provide options that map to different dark side manifestations without using judgmental language.

### Development Readiness Assessment
"When considering areas for professional growth, which of these resonates most strongly with you?"

Frame dark side traits as development opportunities rather than deficits.

## Scoring and Interpretation Framework

### Risk Levels
- **Green Zone (1-2)**: Trait expression within adaptive range
- **Yellow Zone (3)**: Potential for derailment under stress
- **Orange Zone (4)**: Active management needed
- **Red Zone (5)**: Immediate intervention recommended

### Contextual Modifiers
Consider these factors when interpreting scores:
- Current stress levels
- Role requirements
- Team composition
- Organizational culture
- Recent changes or transitions

## Development Planning Integration

### For Each Identified Dark Side Tendency:

1. **Awareness Building**
   - Self-monitoring exercises
   - Feedback collection plans
   - Trigger identification

2. **Skill Development**
   - Complementary skill focus
   - Behavioral practice plans
   - Support system activation

3. **Environmental Optimization**
   - Role crafting opportunities
   - Team composition considerations
   - Stress management strategies

4. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Behavioral tracking metrics
   - Feedback loops
   - Milestone celebrations

## Coaching Conversation Starters

### For High Openness
"I notice you have many creative ideas. How might we ensure your best innovations get the implementation support they deserve?"

### For High Conscientiousness
"Your attention to quality is a real strength. Where might strategically relaxing standards actually improve overall outcomes?"

### For High Extraversion
"Your energy energizes others. How can we ensure everyone's voice is heard while maintaining that positive momentum?"

### For High Agreeableness
"Your collaborative nature is valued. Where might healthy conflict actually strengthen relationships and results?"

### For High Neuroticism
"Your sensitivity to potential issues can be protective. How might we channel that awareness more constructively?"
