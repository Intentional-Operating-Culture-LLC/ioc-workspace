3. **Environmental Design**: Adjust role/team fit where possible
4. **Support Systems**: Identify coaching resources and accountability partners

### Phase 4: Implementation and Monitoring (Ongoing)

3. **Quarterly Assessment**: Repeat key measures to track improvement
4. **Annual Review**: Comprehensive reassessment and planning

## Coaching Conversation Scripts

### Opening Conversation
"I'd like to explore some assessment results with you. This isn't about judgment - it's about understanding your unique strengths and potential blind spots so we can help you be even more effective. The goal is to leverage what you do well while managing areas that might trip you up, especially under stress."

### For High Openness
"Your creative thinking is a real asset. The feedback suggests that sometimes your innovative ideas might benefit from more structured implementation planning. How do you typically bridge the gap between vision and execution?"

### For High Conscientiousness
"Your attention to quality and detail is valued by the team. Some feedback suggests there might be opportunities to balance perfection with efficiency. When do you think high standards are most critical versus when might 'good enough' be acceptable?"

### For High Extraversion
"Your energy and enthusiasm contribute positively to team dynamics. There's some feedback about ensuring everyone gets heard in discussions. How might we leverage your natural leadership while creating space for others to contribute?"

### For High Agreeableness
"Your collaborative approach strengthens team relationships. The assessment suggests you might sometimes agree to things that aren't realistic or avoid necessary difficult conversations. How do you currently balance maintaining harmony with addressing important issues?"

### For High Neuroticism
"Your awareness of potential problems can be protective for the team. Sometimes this sensitivity might create additional stress. How do you currently manage your emotional responses when facing uncertainty or pressure?"
