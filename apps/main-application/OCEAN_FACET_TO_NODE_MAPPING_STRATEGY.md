## 5. Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Address Critical Gaps (Months 1-2)
1. Create missing nodes for Aesthetics, Social Energy, and Interpersonal Values
2. Update prompt library to include facet-specific assessments
3. Enhance reporting to show facet-level insights

### Phase 2: Enhance Existing Mappings (Months 3-4)
1. Refine indirect mappings to be more facet-specific
2. Add facet subscales to existing nodes
3. Create cross-references between related facets

### Phase 3: Tier-Specific Optimization (Months 5-6)
1. Develop tier-specific facet expressions
2. Create progression pathways from Individual to Executive
3. Build organizational culture assessments based on aggregate facets

## 6. Measurement Framework

### Facet Coverage Metrics
- **Current Coverage**: 17/30 facets (57%) have direct mappings
- **With Proposed Nodes**: 27/30 facets (90%) would have direct mappings
- **Remaining Indirect**: 3/30 facets (10%) would remain indirect

### Quality Metrics
- **Direct Mapping Quality**: Average correlation of 0.85
- **Indirect Mapping Quality**: Average correlation of 0.55
- **Post-Implementation Target**: >0.80 average correlation

## 7. Integration with Existing Systems

### OCEAN Scoring Integration
```yaml
OCEAN_Facet_Mapping:
  - facet: "Fantasy"
    code: "O1"
    trait: "Openness"
    ioc_nodes: ["01.02.02.02", "01.03.01.02"]
    strength: "Indirect"
    correlation: 0.65
```

### Archetype Alignment
Each facet should map to archetype expressions:
- High Fantasy (O1) → Explorer, Pioneer archetypes
- High Order (C2) → Anchor, Refiner archetypes
- High Warmth (E1) → Connector, Giver archetypes

## 8. Conclusion

The IOC framework currently provides good coverage for Conscientiousness and mixed coverage for other OCEAN traits at the facet level. By implementing the proposed new nodes and enhancing existing mappings, the framework can achieve >90% direct facet coverage, enabling more precise personality assessment and development planning.

The tier-specific expressions of facets provide a pathway for understanding how personality manifests differently at Individual, Executive, and Organizational levels, supporting more nuanced development strategies and cultural assessments.
